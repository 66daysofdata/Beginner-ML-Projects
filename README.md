# Machine Learning Projects For Beginners

This list is curated to learn ML by making projects on Regression, Classification and Clustering based algorithms.

1. **Cartoonify Image with Machine Learning**

    **Project Idea**: Transform images into its cartoon. Yes, the objective of this machine learning project is to cartoonify the images. 
    Thus, we will build a python application that will transform an image into its cartoon using machine learning libraries.

2. **Iris Flowers Classification**
.
    **Project idea**: This is a beginner friendly project with a very easy dataset to work on. The iris flowers have different species and you can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals.  A basic project for machine learning beginners to predict the species of a new iris flower.

3. **Loan Prediction**

    **Project idea**:  The idea behind this ML project is to build a model that will classify how much loan the user can take. 
    It is based on the userâ€™s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments. We can build a linear model for this project.

4. **Housing Prices Prediction Project**:

    **Project Idea**:  The dataset has house prices of the Boston residential areas.  The expense of the house varies according to various factors like crime rate, number of rooms, etc... It is a good ML project for beginners to predict prices on the basis of new data.

5. **Titanic Survival Project:** <br>
**Project idea**:  This will be a fun project to build as we will be predicting whether someone would have survived if they were in the titanic ship or not. For this beginnerâ€™s project.  We will use the Titanic dataset that contains real data of the survivors and people who died in the Titanic ship.

6. **Wine Quality Test Project**

    **Project idea**: In this project, we can build an interface to predict the quality of the red wine. It will use the chemical information of the wine and based on 
    the machine learning model.  It will give us the result of wine quality.

7. **Fake News Detection Project**

    **Project Idea**:  Fake news spreads like a wildfire and this is a big issue in this era. We can learn how to distinguish fake news from a real one. 
    We can use supervised learning to implement a model like this.
